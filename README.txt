DB Log UI Drupal module
-----------------------

The module overrides default DB log overview page (admin/reports/dblog) with
client side implementation. It does not offer any new features in comparison
with the original interface. The main goal of the module is providing proof of
concept for building embedded Vue.js applications in Drupal 8.
